scatterbug
----------

``scatterbug`` allows you to place your GitHub issues on a chart. It's as easy as that.

You navigate to ``somewhe.re/myorg/myrepo/secret`` and you can push around issues on a map!
Only people with that link (i.e. your secret token) will be able to see and your issue map.

Running it
==========

Run the server by installing the (three. yes.) dependencies in a Python 3.5+ virtualenv, then execute
``gunicorn server:app --bind localhost:8080 --worker-class aiohttp.GunicornWebWorker``. You can also
ignore gunicorn and just run ``SCATTERBUG_DEBUG=True python server.py``.

Run the frontend by running ``npm install`` in the ``client/`` directory, then running ``npm start``.
To build the frontend for production, run ``npm run build``, maybe adjust the URL given
in ``config.prod.js`` beforehand. You'll find the build output in the ``dist/`` directory.

What's missing
==============

- Proper installation instructions. The above are the result of two minutes of work, so they assume
  that you know all the tech. Pull requests welcome.
- Filtering for text or for labels. We already pull all the GitHub information, so we should be
  able to filter for labels just by selecting them. And milestones. And contibutâ€¦ look, it's feature
  creep, it's a perfectly natural software stage, okay?
